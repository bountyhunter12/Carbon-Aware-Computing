# Carbon-Aware-Computing
1. Use ElectricityMaps API for real-time energy mixes and carbon intensity. Find grids with low-carbon sources like hydro, nuclear, wind, and solar.

2. Run ML training jobs on cloud servers chosen for low-carbon electricity, based on average and real-time carbon intensity measurements.

3. Analyze the carbon footprint of Google Cloud usage, including ML training, inference, storage, and API activities.
